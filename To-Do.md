    Information Disclosure Checks: Check for sensitive information disclosure such as server version, directory listings, source code leaks, error messages, or any other information that can be used by an attacker.

    SQL Injection Testing: Implement SQL injection tests to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing: Test for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications by injecting malicious scripts and validating the output.

    CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Testing: Check for CSRF vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.

    File Inclusion Vulnerability Testing: Test for file inclusion vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server.

    XML External Entity (XXE) Testing: Identify XXE vulnerabilities by injecting malicious XML payloads and verifying if the application is vulnerable to XXE attacks.

    Server Misconfigurations: Perform checks for common server misconfigurations such as insecure file or directory permissions, outdated software versions, open database ports, etc.

    Password Cracking: Implement password cracking functionality to test the strength of passwords by attempting to crack hashed passwords using various techniques like dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, etc.

    Session Management Testing: Test for session-related vulnerabilities such as session fixation, session hijacking, or insecure session management.

    API Security Testing: If the application has an API, perform security testing on the API endpoints to identify vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass, insecure direct object references, etc.

    SSL/TLS Security Testing: Check for SSL/TLS vulnerabilities, such as weak ciphers, outdated protocols, certificate issues, or configuration weaknesses.

    Content Security Policy (CSP) Testing: Validate if the application has implemented proper Content Security Policy to mitigate risks associated with cross-site scripting, data injection, etc.

    Client-Side Security Testing: Assess the security of client-side technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and identify vulnerabilities such as DOM-based XSS, client-side injection, etc.

    Authentication and Authorization Testing: Test the effectiveness of the authentication and authorization mechanisms by attempting to bypass or exploit them.

    Mobile Application Security Testing: Extend the scanner script to include mobile application security testing techniques, such as analyzing binary files, testing inter-application communication, reverse engineering, etc.
